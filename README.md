# Enviromental-Sound-Classification-
Final Project for Human Data Analytics Course

### Project description
Environmental sound classification (ESC) is an expanding field with applications in surveillance, smart homes, and urban noise management. However, ESC faces unique challenges due to the diverse nature of environmental sounds and limited labeled data. This project presents a comparison of CNN and CRNN architectures that utilize different audio features, including log-mel spectrograms, MFCCs, and raw waveforms, to determine the most effective approach for ESC. The impact of various data augmentation techniques, such as mixup, white noise injection, and pitch shifting, on the performance of the models is also assessed. Results indicate that the CRNN model with log-mel spectrogram inputs achieve the highest accuracy of 74.80%, capturing intricate patterns across frequencies. Ensemble methods further enhance accuracy, with product-based ensemble surpassing individual models’ performance and reaching an accuracy of 79.10%, compared to an average human accuracy of 81.3%. Analysis of class-wise accuracy suggests that class-specific augmentation strategies may further optimize models’ generalization ability. These considerations offer important perspectives in the field of sound recognition systems, contributing to ongoing progress in enviromental sound classification.
